Snap-Pad provides an easy, somewhat safe two party OTP capability.

Perhaps it will also provide a solution to brain rot due to excessive datasheet exposure. My fucking eyeballs are burning.

TODO
----

* Identify 48-pin MSP430F5xx series chip w/ USB module
* Make library part, layout
* Find lib for USB serial HID profile
* Find lib for NAND bad block management
* Finalize LED and switch count, color, placement
* Initial board layout
* Get pick-n-place up and running
* Get reflow oven up and running
* Send out v0 to OSH Park/AC
* Go over use scenarios with Nick F, Hilary M, David H, other cryptonerds
* Look into OpenMoko USB identifiers (can we really use these?)
** If not, how fucked up would it be to buy in to the USB association?
*** Pretty fucked up, best not to support them
* Board layout for on-board USB edge connector
** Check USB mechanical spec (and anecdotal measurements)
** Check on board thicknesses available through OSH/AC
* Marketing/Spreading the word
** Bring in John D. to see if KS makes sense
*** How do they handle sales tax? Do they handle sales tax?
** Large scale: talk to Limor F, Phil T, Nathan S about excess capacity runs.
* Identify a license. (Talk to Alicia S about this, maybe Dustyn R and Addie W)

Scheduling
----------
* First board assembled by mid-November
* Working prototype by EOM November
* To Market by mid-December
* (Early run for 3C30 in Hamburg? That's last week in December, and David H's experience with even simple goods in German customs was not encouraging)
