These are the Eagle CAD board files and libraries for the Snap-Pad.

The libraries are in the "lbr" directory; the schematics and boards are in the "Snap-Pad" directory.

SP.sch is the schematic for one-half of a Snap-Pad.
SP.brd is the board file for one-half of a Snap-Pad.
SP-twin.brd is the full board file for the twinned Snap-Pad. There is no associated
  schematic; forward/back annotation is severed and the components are cloned to
  avoid any messiness with part naming. It's a symmetrical board.
